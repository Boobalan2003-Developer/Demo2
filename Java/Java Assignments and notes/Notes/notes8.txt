Constructor?

Constructor is a method used to build/construct an object.
A constructor is a method that has the same of the class.
To create an object, a constructor should be called.
A constructor is called using "new" keyword.

programatically, a constructor is also used to initialize the instance variables
of the class.

Types of constructor:
1. default constructor 
               ClassName()
                {

                }
2. parameterized constructor
      ClassName(arg_list)
       {
               coding
       }

**A constructor will never return any values. so the signature of a 
constructor will not have a return_type like ordinary method.


Polymorphims:

Class
Object
Inheritance
Encapsulation / Abstraction
Polymorphism

The ability of a method in a class to be present in multiple forms in same
name.

Types of polymorphism:
1. Compile time polymorphism(early binding) or static polymorphism
2. Runtime polymorphism(late binding) or dynamic polymorphism

Method overloading -> Compile time polymorphism
Method Overriding -> Run-time polymorphism

Method overloading can be achieved by changing the number of arguments,
types of arguements and sequence of arguments.
Method Overloading cannot be achieved by changing the 
return_type of the method.
