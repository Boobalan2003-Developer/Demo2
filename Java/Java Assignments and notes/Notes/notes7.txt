Access Specifiers:
Access specifiers are the tokens to modify the accessibility of a class member outside the class,
or outside the package.

Access Specifiers in Java:
      default - default members are accessible within the class and outside the class of 
                      same package.
      private - private members are accessible only inside the same class.
       protected - a protected member of a class can be accessed only within the sub class of same 
                            package.
       public - a public member of a class can be accessed outside the class within the same package
                    or different package.


class A
{
      int a,b,c;
     void read()
      {   }
      void print()
      {   {
}

class B
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {

    }
}


Inhertiance:

 The process of deriving the features of an existing class to the newly developed class is called
inheritance. Inheritance ensures data integrity. It avoid duplication of data and process in multiple
instance.

Types of inheritance:
      Java supports single inheritance and multi-level inheritance.
   In java no class will inherit more than one class at a time.

How to inherit a class:
      "extends" keyword is used to inherit a class.
  eg:

 class ClassA{

}

class ClassB extends ClassA /* all the public, default and protected members of ClassA will be inherited.
{
     
}

java.lang.object is the default super class for all java classes.

**Private methods and variables cannot be inherited to sub classes.

**final class cannot be inherited.

class relationships:
same package subclass
same package non sub class

different package subclass
different package non sub class
