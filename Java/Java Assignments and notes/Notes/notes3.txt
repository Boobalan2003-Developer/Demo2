class and object -> the basic building block or basic components
of object oriented programming.


class is a collection of methods and attributes.

class members -> methods(functions) 
object -> instance(memory) of a class. an object is used to access the methods of a class.

int a;
a=10;

A a1;
a1=new A();

A a1=new A();

class A
{
    public static void main(String args[])
   {

   }
}

To read runtime input from the user, java.io.DataInputStream class is used.
java.io.DataInputStream.readLine() - this method is used to read input from the console.

Creating object for java.io.DataInputStream:

  DataInputStream dis=new DataInputStream(System.in);
  String name;

  System.out.print("\n\tEnter your name: ");
  name=dis.readLine();

Method:
              A  block of code that is defined inside a class that performs a particular task.

A method has a specific syntax:

           return_type methodName(arguments)
           {
                    code1;
                    code2;
                    code3;
           }

arguements:- The values passed as inputs for a method is called as arguments
                         A method can take any number of arguements of any type.

return_value:- The value that is return by the method when it is called.
                         A method will return only one value at a time.

    float findSum(float a,float b, float c)
    {
            float d=a+b+c;
            return d;
    }

    int findBig(int a,int b, int c)
    {
           if(a>b && a>c)
                return a;
           else if(b>a && b>c)
                   return b;
           else
                   return c;
    }

   void findSum(int a,int b)
  {
      no return value;

  }

//a=12, b=20, c=1
//a=100,b=21,c=150
//a=150,b=12,c=100

usage of methods in a class ensures reusability and modularity.

A program can have multiple classes. The program can be saved using the classname which
has a main method. 

On compiling that program, every class in the program will be compiled separately and class files
will be created for each class.

The class with main function can be executed.
the class without main function cannot be executed.
