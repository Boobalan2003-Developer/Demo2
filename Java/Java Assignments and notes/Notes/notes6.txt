Variables in Java:

1. static variables - the variables declared inside the class with static keyword.  These variables
belongs the class. Hence objects are not required to access the static variables.

2. instance variables - variables declared inside the class. These variable belongs to the object
of the class. Hence object is required to access the instance variables of the class.

instance(memory) of a class -> object of a class

new-> dynamic memory allocation operator.

ClassName obj_name=new ClassName();

eg)

 class VariableDemo
{
     int a,b; //instance variable / non-static variable
     static int c; //static variable
}

static variables are created on class loading
instance variables are created when an object is created.
