/* Java Naming Convention*/

/*Java API Structure*/

packages - java.io, java.lang, java.rmi, java.util, java.net, javax.swing
   packages are the collection of classes, abstract classes, interfaces

Classes -> java.io.DataInputStream,java.io.BufferedInputStream,
                   javax.swing.Button, java.lang.String
  Classes are the collection of methods and fields.

method -> java.io.DataInputStream.readLine();
                  java.lang.String.toString()

field -> are defined as the constant variables inside a class -> MAXIMIZED_BOTH


Data types:

   What are the values that can be used for processing a result?

Primary Datatypes
    Numericals -> int(Integer), float(Float), double(Double), long(Long),byte(Byte), short(Short)
    boolean - true / false
    characters -> Character, String

Reference Data types
 The variables that are used to store an object of a class is called Reference data type.

Variable:
   A variable is named location used to store a single data(value) during the program execution.

Syntax to Declare a variable:

    data_type variable_name;
  
   int a;
   float avg;
   double area;

Reading Input from the user:

Usually we can read user input using two classes.
1. java.io.DataInputStream.
2. java.util.Scanner.

syntax to create an object for a class:

ClassName objectnme=new ClassName();
new -> dynamic memory allocation operator.
