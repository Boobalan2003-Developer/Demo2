Exception: Exceptions are defined as the unexpected happening or scenario during the
program execution.
	An exception will make the program to halt(hang/quit) instantly.
 So a programmer to think over all the possible cases of input and output in the program.
This is called as exception handling in java.

Exception handling Techniques:
1. try - try is a block of code that contains the codes that might raise exceptions

2. catch - catch is a block of code that contains the codes that are to be executed when an 
               Exception object is raised.

3. finally - finally is a block of code that contains the code that are to be executed even when an
                Exception object is raised.

4.throw - it is a keyword that makes an Exception object to be thrown out of the try block.

5.throws - it is a keyword that specifies the compiler that the method has a probability of 
                  throwing an Exception object

A try block can have multiple catch blocks.
A try block should always be continued with atleast one catch block of finally block.

Types of Exceptions:
1. Checked Exceptions - Probability of exceptions are checked during compile time.
                     java.io.IOException
2. Unchecked Exceptions  - Probability of exceptions are not checked during compile time.
                   java.lang.ArithmeticException, java.util.InputMismatchException

Exception objects are throwable in nature.
