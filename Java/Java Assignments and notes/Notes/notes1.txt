Course -> java full stack:

1. core java programming - J2SE(Desktop Application - Standalone Applications)
2. HTML+CSS+JavaScript+Jquery+ajax
3. Advanced Java - J2EE - (Web based applications and cloud based applications)
4. Android App Developement(mobile applications).

1 language: Core Java.

Java - is an Object oriented programming language. 1990's.
           Developed by James Gosling. 
           Developed at Sun MicroSystems and later in 2000, java was acquired by Oracle Inc.
           Newly developed language was initially called as OAK, later changed GREEN


Automated Devices -> LCD Projector- Searches for source of input
                                       HDMI 1, HDMI 2, Comp1, Comp2, Aux1, Axu2
           auto search for input - its a tiny bit of code that runs on a microchip, and controls the device
         after 5 minutes of idle state -> it switches off the lamp.

What are the principles of Java:
1. _____ should be object oriented.
2. ______should be robust(strong).
3._______should be platform independent.(to be executed in all platforms)
4. _______ should be api driven.
5. ______should be very easy to learn and code.
6.______ should be familiar.

After developement: due to its simplicity and its robustness , James Gosling -> made Java
 as a GUL(General User Licensing). No restrictions to use Java Development Kit.

Java is a programming language.

Types of Java:

1. J2SE - Java 2 Platform Standard Edition(Core Java) -> Tally 
2. J2EE - Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition(Advanced Java) -> all online payment gateways
3. J2ME - Java 2 Platform Micro Edition(mobile java) -> all portable digital gadgets(embedded systems)

What are the tools to develope a java program:

1. JDK - Java Development Kit
         - can be downloded from oraclce.com
      Components of JDK:
                  1. Java API (Application Programming Interface)
                   2. JVM - Java Virtual Machine(Java Interpreter)
                   3. JIT Compiler.
                   4. JRE - Java Runtime Environment.

2.  text processor(notepad) - to develope source code

3.Console - It is the terminal to execute the program and to see the output

notepad and cmd prompt.

Java source code should be stored as FileName.java

command to compile a java program:

 javac FileName.java

command to execute a java class file:

java ClassName
