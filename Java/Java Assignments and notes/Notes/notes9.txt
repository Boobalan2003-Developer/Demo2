Abstract Class:
The class which is defined using the abstract keyword.
An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
An abstract class can contain both abstract methods and non-abstract methods.

abstract method: The method defined using the abstract keyword. 
 An abstract method wont have the method body(definition)

non-abstract: the methods with definition(body)

abstract class Abs
{
    void printValues()
    {
            statements;
   }
  abstract void printDemo();
}

concerete class -> the class that can be instantiated.

An abstract class has to be extended to a concerete class and all the abstract methods has be to
overridden in the concerete class before calling.

Interfaces:

Interfaces are the abstract class like component, but defined using interface keyword.

syntax:

                interface Interface()
                {
                     abstract methods;
                }

1. Interface cannot be instantiated.
2. Interfaces has to be implemented into a concerete class and all the methods has to be overridden
3. A class can implement more than one interface at the same time.
4. All the methods defined inside the interface are abstract and public by default in definition

class Demo extends Class implements Demo1, Demo2
{

}
